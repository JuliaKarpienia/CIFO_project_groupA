## Sports League Optimization using Genetic Algorithms (GA)

This project applies GA to solve an optimization problem in a fantasy spots league setting. The goal is to assign 35 players across 5 teams in a way that ensures:
* Balanced teams skill levels
* Valid team formation
* Salary cap compliance.

<br> Each player is defined by their skill rating, salary and position (Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder or Forward). 

<br> Problem Constraints:
* Each team must consist of: 1 Goalkeeper (GK), 2 Defenders (DEF), 2 Midfielders (MID) and 2 Forwards (FWD)
* Each player must be assigned to only one team
* Each team’s total salary cannot exceed a  750€ million total budget
<br> If solution is validation those constraints then it is then not a valid solution and the fitness value should reflect that
